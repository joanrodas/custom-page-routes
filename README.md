Plubo is a really simple WordPress plugin boilerplate created to speed up plugin development.


✔️  Use Blade views and directives from the start\
✔️  Add styles in SCSS\
✔️  JavaScript router lets you add scripts on specific WordPress templates (based on body tags) and on specific shortcode tags

There are 2 options to start using Plubo:

### 1. As a GitHub template

If you intend to use GitHub for your project, your best option is to create a new repo using this one as a template, just clicking the ***Use this template*** button.

> When using Plubo as a template, a pipeline will be executed right after the repo creation, modifiyng the filenames and classes to match your new project name. The pipeline files will be autoremoved.

### 2. With composer

`composer create-project joanrodas/custom-page-routes <PROJECT_NAME>`

> After creating the project, use the command php plubo add to add Alpine.js, React and/or environment variables to your project.

<br/>

## Add Alpine.js to your project

You can add Alpine.js with a simple command
`php plubo add alpine`

<br/>

## Create a React app as a WordPress shortcode automagically! :rocket::rocket::rocket:

If you need to use React in your project, Plubo can prepare a simple structure for you :smiley:

`php plubo add react <APP_NAME>`

> **Note:** If you don't enter an app name, a random one will be assigned.
